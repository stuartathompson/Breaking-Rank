        <p style="width:620px;">Conservative Members of Parliament were far more likely to vote against their fellow caucus members than MPs from other parties, according to an analysis by The Globe and Mail of more than 162,000 individual votes by MPs between June 2, 2011 through Jan. 28, 2013.

        	<h3>Conservatives broke rank more often</h3>
        	Below, MPs are divided by those who broke party ranks at least once (on the left) with those who always voted along party lines. Conservatives (in blue) were far more likely to vote against their caucus than members from other parties. "I guess in principle, we're more democratic than other parties," said Government Whip Gordon O'Connor.</div>
        	<div>
        		<h3>Party unity is very high</h3>
	        	Even MPs with the lowest party unity vote along party lines more than 97 per cent of the time. The chart below is organized by the per cent of party unity. Then-NDP MP Bruce Hyer voted against his caucus more than other MPs, but he soon left the party to stand as an independent. Only his votes as NDP member are counted here.

        	<div>
        	<h3>Many broke rank only once</h3>
        	This chart, organized by the number of votes an MP made against the majority of their caucus, shows many MPs only dissented once (the collection of MPs on the right). Many Conservatives split on a motion to study the beginning of life &mdash; the majority of Tories voted for it, while a minority, including Prime Minister Stephen Harper, voted against.</div>
